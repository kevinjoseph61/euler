## Problem #2: Even Fibonacci numbers

### Question
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... 
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Answer
- A basic solution that we can think of is a simple iteration one that stores all the Fibonacci sequence numbers in an array by using the previous two indexes until we reach the required number and sum it as we go if it's even. This would result in an O(n) space and time complexity but that will not pass the tests.
- We can definitely get rid of the space complexity because we're only using the previous two indexes so we can just store what we need; the previous two indexes values.
- But then we have to think faster. If we carefully observe the sequence we see that only the every third in the sequence is actually being used so actually 1/3rd of our calculations are futile?!
- We can try to get a new relation between the even numbers of the sequence ie 0,2,8,34... And we actually succeed in doing so as we can get f(n) = 4 x f(n-1) + f(n-2)
- We can use this in our calculations and sum it up in Python as
~~~
curr, prev, sums=2, 0, 0
    while curr<n:
        sums, curr, prev = sums + curr, 4 * curr + prev, curr
~~~
- Hence we can get a better utilization.
